# Overview

Brawlcord is a Discord bot, an intance of [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot), which allows users to play a simplified version of the game [Brawl Stars](https://brawlstars.com) (developed by Supercell) on Discord.  

> Fast-paced multiplayer battles from the makers of Clash of Clans, Clash Royale and Boom Beach.

Battle with friends or solo across a variety of game modes in under three minutes. Unlock and upgrade dozens of Brawlers with powerful super abilities. Purchase and collect unique skins to stand out and show off in the arena. Join or start a band to share tactics and fight together.

## How To Use

You can use the bot in the [Brawlcord Community Server](https://discord.gg/7zJ3PbJ) or invite it to your own server using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=644118957917208576&scope=bot&permissions=311360).  

**Note 1:** By using the link above, Brawlcord will be able to embed links, attach files, add reactions, and use external emojis wherever allowed. You can remove the permissions manually, but that may break the bot.  

**Note 2:** During the beta phase, the bot will not be online most of the times. I plan on hosting the bot on a VPS soon.  

## Features

The cog replicates the real game in a number of ways while adapting to the text-based form of Discord. It has the following features:

- Battle against the bot or other players for glory (and rewards)  
- Unlock and collect new, powerful Brawlers - each with a signature attack and SUPER ability
- Climb to the top of the leaderboards in global and local rankings
- Customize Brawlers with unlockable skins
- See your stats and show off to friends

## Installation

First make sure you have Red Bot V3 installed. Instructions to install Red Bot can be found [here](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot#installation).

Next add my repo using the following command:

> Note: [p] will be your prefix in all of the following commands.  

`[p]repo add brawlcord https://github.com/snowsee/brawlcord`

Then, you will have to install cog by using the following command:

`[p]cog install brawlcord brawlcord`

You should see the following message after the installation:
> Thank you for installing the Brawlcord cog, based on the mobile game Brawl Stars (developed by Supercell).

Load the cog once you see that message using the following command:
`[p]load brawlcord`

Make sure that you use the `[p]cog update` command to periodically update your cogs. This will ensure that you are getting the latest bug fixes and features. You may also update a specific cog by using `[p]cog update brawlcord`.

**Important Note**: The cog uses external Brawl Stars emotes. They are stored in the following four Discord servers:

- [Brawlcord Community Server](https://discord.gg/7zJ3PbJ)
- [Brawlcord Emotes: SP 1](https://discord.gg/hnKktBN)
- [Brawlcord Emotes: Ranks](https://discord.gg/G4Krvk3)
- [Brawlcord Emotes: Brawlers and Game Modes](https://discord.gg/ACq3ZrE)

Unfortunately, due to Discord limitations, you can't add your bot to these servers directly. In order to have your bot added to the abovementioned servers, you must send me a direct message with your bot's OAuth invite link. While I know this isn't ideal, this is currently the only working way. I'll work on adding an option to disable emotes in the future.  

My Discord username: **Snowsy#0592**
