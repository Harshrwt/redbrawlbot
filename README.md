## Overview

Brawlcord is a Discord bot which allows users to play a simplified version of the game [Brawl Stars](https://brawlstars.com) (developed by Supercell) on Discord. It is an instance of [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).

The cog replicates the real game in a number of ways while adapting to the text-based form of Discord. It has the following features:

- Battle against the bot or other players for glory (and rewards)  
- Unlock and collect new, powerful Brawlers - each with a signature attack and SUPER ability
- Climb to the top of the leaderboards in global and local rankings
- Customize Brawlers with unlockable skins
- See your stats and show off to friends  

## How To Use

You can use the bot in the [Brawlcord Community Server](https://discord.gg/7zJ3PbJ) or invite it to your own server using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=644118957917208576&scope=bot&permissions=322624&scope=bot).

**Note:** By using the link above, Brawlcord will be able to read messages, send messages, manage messages, embed links, attach files, add reactions, and use external emojis wherever allowed. You can remove the permissions manually, but that may break the bot.  

More information about bot commands and hosting can be found [here](https://brawlcord.github.io/).
